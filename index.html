  From 1997 to 2007, the top three Asian nations in terms of total terrorist attacks were <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong> and <strong>India</strong>. 
  Other Asian countries, on the other hand, experienced fewer terrorist strikes. 
  <br/><br/>Furthermore, terrorist attacks were primarily concentrated in <strong>Northern Africa</strong>. 
  <br/><strong>Russia</strong> is the European country with the most terrorist strikes in the north.

  According to the bar chart, the total number of terrorist attacks has shown an <strong>upward trend</strong>. 
  The greatest number of occurrences happened in <strong>2014</strong>. 
  <br/><br/>Fixing the period in the interval of 2014 reveals that <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong> and <strong>India</strong> remain prominent although <strong> Iraq </strong> has the highest number of terrorist events.

    From 1997 to 2017, the number of <span class="injury_text"><strong>injuries</strong></span> and <span class="death_text"><strong>deaths</strong></span> per 10,000 people increased along with the increase in the number of terrorist incidents. 
    <br/><br/>However, the <span class="injury_text"><strong>injury rate</strong></span>  per 10,000 people was always higher than the <span class="death_text"><strong>death rate</strong></span> except in 2014. 
    <br/><br/>Meanwhile, three peaks can be seen in 2001, 2007 and 2014, which respectively are <span class="injury_text"><strong>4.2% and 5.7% injury rate</strong></span> and <span class="death_text"><strong>6.6% death rate</strong></span>.

    During these 20 years, no matter what year it was, the type of terrorist attacks was dominated by <span class="attacktype_text"><strong>explosions</strong></span>. 
    <br/><br/>Therefore, we made bold assumption that explosions contributed the majority of the injury and death rate. 
    <br/><br/> In addition, the amount of terrorist incidents caused by <span class="attacktype2_text"><strong>armed assaults</strong></span> has steadily grown since 2008.

    <strong> Explosive materials</strong> and <strong>firearms</strong> are used as the primary weapons of terrorist attacks. 
    <br/><br/>However, biological materials, chemical materials and vehicles are rarely used. 
    <br/><strong>Radioactive elements</strong> as weapons only appeared in 2000 and 2007. 
    <br/><br/>It is interesting that <strong>fake weapons</strong> are even an option;
    <br/><br/>Combined with the above figure, <strong>explosive terrorist attacks</strong> and <strong>explosive materials</strong> have similar trends in the past 20 years. 
    <br/><br/>So, we speculate that explosive terrorist attacks are directly caused by explosive materials, rather than indirectly using other things to cause explosions.
